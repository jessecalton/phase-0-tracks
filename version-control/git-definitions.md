# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge those revisions made by different people. I liken it to the tracking changes and merge features in Microsoft Word. It's useful because if there is ever a mistake or something you'd like removed, you can revert back to the moment in time where that edit took place. You will also know the author of the changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch gives you a copy of your master file to work on. With branching, you can work on multiple versions of your project and merge them with your master file at the end of the day and see if you like the changes that you made. Any changes you don't like can be rolled back or altered in the branch. Other people on your team can also work with branches to eventually merge with the master file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in your Git file. You will want to include a message that says what you did in your update from the most recent commit. Also included in a commit will be a timestamp, author, and a commit ID.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs whenever two users make conflicting changes in the same file. One person may have deleted or altered something and the other person may not have. Git will ask you to resolve that conflict before it can complete the merge....
