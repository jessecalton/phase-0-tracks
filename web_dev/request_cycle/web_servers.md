<!-- What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system? -->

Linux assumes you know what you are doing and allows you to do anything you tell it to. It's egalitarian in that it treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power.

Linux is distributed under an open source license, allowing the user a lot of freedom. You can run any program for any purpose, modify that program, redistribute copies and your own modified copies to others.

It's "by the people, for the people."

<!-- In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS? -->

In a VPS, a bigger server plays host to the VPS server, which hosts its own copy of the operating system and allocated server resources.

VPS hosting gives a user a higher performance than a shared server. It has all the makings of a virtual dedicated server, thus allowing more control than if a user was on a shared server.

VPS hosting tends to be a better choice for heavy incoming traffic, but is typically more expensive than shared hosting.
