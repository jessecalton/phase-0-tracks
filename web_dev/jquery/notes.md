<!-- A plan to tackle jQuery and learn as much as I can in two hours -->

Plan:

Google searches: what is jquery; practical uses of jquery;
    View multiple search results
    Skim for readability before deciding to spend more time on one page.
    If something looks to advanced, skip it and try another more introductory page.
    Write important notes in Evernote
Look for any cheat sheets or quick reference guides for jQuery beginners.

Take a 5 minute mental break every 40 mins. Let the mind go over the information if it wants to. Come back and review notes before resuming research.

<!-- Release 1: most effective strategies: -->
I found plenty of resources and beginner's instructions on the W3Schools website. There was nothing beyond the scope of what I already knew about jQuery (which was basically nothing), so I wasn't ever lost.

One thing that helped me grasp the concepts easier were the examples. The examples provided on the W3Schools website allow a user to see the code and alter the code for some good trial-and-error learning.

I wrote down examples in my notes and explained the process behind them.

I will likely go back to this site for reference, as there are plenty of practical examples of how to use jQuery even if you are just a beginner.
