  <p>Last year's NBA Finals was lit! <strong> LeBron James cemented his legacy as the <em>greatest of all time</em> behind Michael Jordan.</strong></p>
  <p>Here are some significant events that happened in last year's Finals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Warriors blew a 3-1 lead.</li>
  </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>The Warriors had won 73 regular season games</li>
        <li>Last year they narrowly defeated an injury-depleted Cavaliers team to win the championship.</li>
        <li>The Warriors and the Sacramento Kings have the same amount of 2016 championship rings.</li>
      </ol>
   <ul>
    <li>The Cavaliers won their first ever NBA title.</li>
  </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>They now have as many championship banners as the Sacramento Kings franchise.</li>
        <li>It was Cleveland's first championship team since 1960.</li>
        <li>J.R. Smith was a starter on that team.</li>
      </ol>
